# People-and-Vehicle-Detection

A model which detects 4 specific people or vechicle using Transfer learning and Tensorflow.

This project has two models. 
One to identify if an image has one of the following 4 people:
1. Narendra Modi
2. Rahul Gandhi
3. Arvind Kejriwal
4. Donald Trump

The second can recognize if the model has one (or more) of the follwing cars:
1. Hyundai i20
2. Maruti Suziki Swift
3. BMW M3
4. Ford Endeavour

## How to use?

Please download the models from [this Google Drive 🔗](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vb_ZYMfwxFOLMqQltyg_zJDnT1dvVsC0?usp=sharing) and place them in the models 📁. There is no need to download all the files given in the link, just download the `.pb` files. Or download the whole folder and replce the already present 'models' 📁 in the repo 📁.

Download Imagenet from [this 🔗](http://download.tensorflow.org/models/image/imagenet/inception-2015-12-05.tgz) and extract it in the repo 📁.

That's it! Now you can run the `People-and-Vehicle-Detection.ipynb` notebook!
